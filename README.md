At present, we are seeking comments and bugfixes on the Indic-script
documents. Interested readers and contributors can begin at the [Indic
General](opentype-shaping-indic-general.md) shaping document and are encouraged to submit their feedback
on the text or images of any of the linked Indic scripts.

In its final form, this repository will hold documentation describing
the shaping behavior used for layout of OpenType text. In particular,
it will focus on complex scripts.
