## General information ##

The Arabic script is used to write multiple languages, most commonly
Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Pashto, Kurdish, and Azerbaijani. 

The Arabic script encompasses multiple distinct styles, including Naskh, 
Nataliq, and Kufi, that share a number of common features and rules,
but that differ considerably in their final appearance. Due to the
common features found between the styles, a shaping engine can support
all styles of Arabic with a single shaping model.

In addition, several other writing systems that observe similar rules
and conventions can be supported using the same shaping model, even if
they are not historically related to Arabic. These scripts include:

  - N'Ko
  - Syriac
  - Mongolian

Note that each of these scripts has its own independent
script tag defined in OpenType. N'Ko uses `<nko>`, Syriac uses `<syrc>`, and
Mongolian uses `<mong>`. The information found below about the `<arab>`
script shaping model can serve as a general guide; script-specific
information can be found in the linked document for each script. 

Arabic is a joining script that uses inter-word spaces, so each
codepoint in a text run may be substituted with one of several
contextual forms corresponding to its position in a
word. Most, but not all, letter sequences join; shaping engines must
track which positions trigger joining behavior for each letter.

Arabic is written (and, therefore, rendered) from right to
left. Shaping engines must track the directionality of the text run
when scripts of different direction are mixed.

## Terminology ##

OpenType shaping uses a standard set of terms for elements of the
Arabic script. The terms used colloquially in any particular language
may vary, however, potentially causing confusion.

**Base** glyph or character is the standard term for a Arabic
character that is capable of taking a diacritical mark. 

Most of the base characters in Arabic are consonants, but each
language written with the Arabic script may have one or more vowel
base letters.

Vowels that are not base characters are frequently omitted from the
text run entirely. Alternatively, such a vowel may appear as a
diacritical mark called a **á¸¥arakah**.

**Ijam** is the standard term for an above- or below-base dot that
distinguishes one consonant from another. Ijam are not considered
diacritics; they are integral to the consonant of which they are a part.

**Shadda** and **tashdid** are both standard terms for the "consonant
doubling" diacritical mark.

**Hamza** is the standard term for the glottal stop
semi-consonant. The hamza is not regarded as a full letter in most
languages, although it can appear as a stand-alone letter within
words. In some sequences, the hamza attaches to an adjacent letter;
when a hamza-supporting letter is not adjacent, however, the hamza can
appear on its own.

**Kashida** (or **tatweel**) is the term for a glyph inserted into a
sequence for the purpose of elongating the baseline stroke of a
letter. Unicode documents use the term "tatweel" most frequently,
while OpenType documents use the term "kashida" most
frequently. Kashidas are typically inserted in order to justify lines
of text. 


## Glyph classification ##

Because Arabic is a joining (or cursive) script, proper shaping of
text runs involves identifying the joining behavior of each character,
then combining that information with any preceding or subsequent
characters to determine the contextually correct form for display.

### Joining properties ###

Arabic characters are assigned a `JOINING_TYPE` property in the
Unicode standard that indicates how they join to adjacent
characters. There are six possible values: 

  - `JOINING_TYPE_LEFT` indicates that a character joins with
    the subsequent character, but does not join with the preceding
    character. 
	
  - `JOINING_TYPE_RIGHT` indicates that a character joins with the
    preceding character, but does not join with the subsequent character.	

  - `JOINING_TYPE_DUAL` indicates that a character joins with the
    preceding character and joins with the subsequent character.
	
  - `JOINING_TYPE_NON_JOINING` indicates that a character does not
    join with the preceding or with the subsequent character.
	
  - `JOINING_TYPE_TRANSPARENT` indicates that the character does not
    join with adjacent characters _and_ that the character must be
    skipped over when the shaping engine is evaluating the joining
    positions in a sequence of characters. When a
    `JOINING_TYPE_TRANSPARENT` character is encountered in a sequence,
    the `JOINING_TYPE` of the preceding character passes
    through. Diacritical marks are frequently assigned this value. 
	
  - `JOINING_TYPE_JOIN_CAUSING` indicates that the character forces
    the use of joining forms with the preceding and subsequent
    characters. Kashidas and the Zero Width Joiner (`U+200D`) are both
    `JOIN_CAUSING` characters.
  

Arabic letters are also assigned to a `JOINING_GROUP` that indicates
which fundamental character they behave like with regard to joining
behavior. Each of the basic letters in the Arabic block tends to
belong to its own `JOINING_GROUP`, while letters from the supplemental and
extended blocks are usually assigned to the `JOINING_GROUP` that
corresponds to the character's base letter, with no diacritics or ijam.

For example, the Persian letter "Peh" (`U+067E`) is visually
represented as the Arabic letter "Beh" (`U+0628`), but with two additional
below-base ijam. Consequently, "Peh" is assigned to the `BEH` `JOINING_GROUP`.

### Mark classification ###

The Unicode standard defines a _canonical combining class_ for each
codepoint that is used whenever a sequence needs to be sorted into
canonical order. 

Several of the Arabic marks belong to standard combining
classes:

| Codepoint | Combining class | Glyph                              |
|:----------|:----------------|:-----------------------------------|
|`U+064B`   | 27              | &#x064B; Fathatan / Open fathatan  |
|`U+064C`   | 28              | &#x064C; Dammatan / Open dammatan  |
|`U+064D`   | 29              | &#x064D; Kasratan / Open Kasratan  |
|`U+064E`   | 30              | &#x064E; Fatha / Small fatha       |
|`U+064F`   | 31              | &#x064F; Damma / Small damma       |
|`U+0650`   | 32              | &#x0650; Kasra / Small kasra       |
|`U+0651`   | 33              | &#x0651; Shadda                    |
|`U+0652`   | 34              | &#x0652; Sukun                     |
|`U+0670`   | 35              | &#x0670; Superscript Alef          |
|           | 220             | Other below-base combining marks   |
|           | 230             | Other above-base combining marks   |

The numeric values of these combining classes are used during Unicode
normalization.

A subset of the Arabic marks require special handling when shaping
Arabic text, during the mark-reordering stage. These include two sets
of _Modifier Combining Marks_ (MCM) that may need to be repositioned
closer to the base character, when they occur in sequences of multiple
marks. 

The sets are:
  - Below-base (class 220) MCMs: "Hamza below" (`U+0655`), "Small low seen"
    (`U+06E3`)
  - Above-base (class 230) MCMs: "Hamza above" (`U+0654`), "Mark noon ghunna"
    (`U+0658`), "Small high seen" (`U+06DC`), "Small high yeh" (`U+06E7`), "Small high
    noon" (`U+06E8`), "Small high waw" (`U+08F3`)

These classifications are used in the [mark-reordering stage](#6-mark-reordering).

<!--- Arabic diacritical marks are grouped into classes. Multiple diacritics
may be placed on the same base, subject to two conditions:

  - No more than one mark from each class is permitted
  - The DIAC1 and DIAC2 classes are mutually exclusive: a base glyph cannot
    accept both a DIAC1 mark and a DIAC2 mark.
	
Mark-and-base combinations that violate these conditions should be
regarded as ivalid. Shapers may attempt to deal gracefully with
such sequences, but no guarantees should be provided as to how the
sequence are shaped. --->
  
<!--- From MS Uniscribe web docs --->

<!---  - `DIAC1` - Above-base (`U+064B`, `U+064C`, `U+064E`, `U+064F`,
            `U+0652`, `U+0657`, `U+0658`, `U+06E1`)
  - `DIAC2` - Below-base (`U+064D`, `U+0650`, `U+0656`)

### Character tables ###

Separate character tables are provided for the Arabic, Arabic
Supplement, Arabic Extended-A, Rumi Numeral Symbols, and Arabic
Mathematical Symbols blocks, as well as for other miscellaneous
characters that are used in `<arab>` text runs:

  - [Arabic character table](character-tables/character-tables-arabic.md#arabic-character-table)
  - [Arabic Supplement character table](character-tables/character-tables-arabic.md#arabic-supplement-character-table)
  - [Arabic Extended-A character table](character-tables/character-tables-arabic.md#arabic-extended-a-character-table)
  - [Rumi Numeral Symbols character table](character-tables/character-tables-arabic.md#rumi-numeral-symbols-character-table)
  - [Miscellaneous character table](character-tables/character-tables-arabic.md#miscellaneous-character-table)

<!--- Commenting out Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block 
      since it does not involve text shaping AFAICT. --->
<!---   - [Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols character table](character-tables/character-tables-arabic.md#arabic-mathematical-alphabetic-symbols-character-table) --->

Unicode also defines two blocks that implement backward compatibility
with retired file-encoding formats:

  - Arabic Presentation Forms-A
  - Arabic Presentation Forms-B
  
Unless a software application is required to support specific stores of
documents that are known to have used these older encodings, however, the
shaping engine should not be expected to handle any text runs
incorporating codepoints from these blocks.

The tables list each codepoint along with its Unicode general
category and its joining type. For letters, the table lists the
codepoint's joining group. For diacritical marks, the table lists the
codepoint's mark combining class. The codepoint's Unicode name and an example
glyph are also provided.

For example:

| Codepoint | Unicode category | Joining type | Joining group | Mark class | Glyph                        |
|:----------|:-----------------|:-------------|:--------------|:-----------|:-----------------------------|
|`U+0628`   | Letter           | DUAL         | BEH           | _null_     | &#x0628; Beh                 |
| | | | | |
|`U+0655`   | Mark [Mc]        | TRANSPARENT  | _null_        | 220_MCM   | &#x0655; Hamza Below         |



Codepoints with no assigned meaning are
designated as _unassigned_ in the _Unicode category_ column. 


<!--- Character table example and explanation --->

Other important characters that may be encountered when shaping runs
of Arabic text include the dotted-circle placeholder (`U+25CC`), the
combining grapheme joiner (`U+034F`), the zero-width joiner (`U+200D`)
and zero-width non-joiner (`U+200C`), the left-to-right text marker
(`U+200E`) and right-to-left text marker (`U+200F`), and the no-break
space (`U+00A0`).

The dotted-circle placeholder is frequently used when displaying a
vowel or diacritical mark in isolation. Real-world text documents may
also use other characters, such as hyphens or dashes, in a similar
placeholder fashion; shaping engines should cope with this situation
gracefully.

The combining grapheme joiner (CGJ) is primarily used to alter the
order in which adjacent marks are positioned during the
mark-reordering stage, in order to adhere to the needs of a
non-default language orthography.
<!--- combining grapheme joiner explanation --->

The zero-width joiner (ZWJ) is primarily used to force the usage of the
cursive connecting form of a letter even when the context of the
adjoining letters would not trigger the connecting form. 

For example, to show the initial form of a letter in isolation (such
as for dislaying it in a table of forms), the sequence "_Letter_,ZWJ"
would be used. To show the medial form of a letter in isolation, the
sequence "ZWJ,_Letter_,ZWJ" would be used.


<!--- Zero-Width Non Joiner explanation --->

The right-to-left mark (RLM) and left-to-right mark (LRM) are used by
the Unicode bidirectionality algorithm (BiDi) to indicate the points
in a text run at which the writing direction changes.


<!--- How shaping is affected by the LTR and RTL markers explanation --->


The no-break space is primarily used to display those codepoints that
are defined as non-spacing (such as vowel or diacritical marks and "Hamza") in an
isolated context, as an alternative to displaying them superimposed on
the dotted-circle placeholder.


## The `<arab>` shaping model ##

Processing a run of `<arab>` text involves seven top-level stages:

1. Compound character composition and decomposition
2. Computing letter joining states
3. Applying the `stch` feature
4. Applying the language-form substitution features from GSUB
5. Applying the typographic-form substitution features from GSUB
6. Mark reordering
7. Applying the positioning features from GPOS


### 1. Compound character composition and decomposition ###

The `ccmp` feature allows a font to substitute

 - mark-and-base sequences with a pre-composed glyph including both
   the mark and the base (as is done in with a ligature substitution)
 - individual compound glyphs with the equivalent sequence of
   decomposed glyphs
 
If present, these composition and decomposition substitutions must be
performed before applying any other GSUB or GPOS lookups, because
those lookups may be written to match only the `ccmp`-substituted
glyphs. 


### 2. Computing letter joining states ###

In order to correctly apply the initial, medial, and final form
substitutions from GSUB during stage 5, the shaping engine must
tag every letter for possible application of the appropriate feature.

To determine which feature is appropriate, the shaping engine must
examine each word in turn and compute each letter's joining state from
the letter's `JOINING_TYPE` and the `JOINING_TYPE` of the
preceding character (if any).

This computation starts from the first letter of the word, temporarily
tagging the letter for `isol` substitution. If the first
letter is the only letter in the word, the `isol` tag will remain unchanged.

From here, the algorithm consumes each character in the string, one at
a time, keeping track of the JOINING_TYPE of the previous character. 

> Note: The following algorithm includes rules for processing `<syrc>`
> text in addition to `<arab>` text. Implementers concerned only with
> shaping `<arab>` text can omit the portions for `<syrc>`-specific rules.

If the current character is JOINING_TYPE_TRANSPARENT, move on to the next
character but preserve the currently-tracked JOINING_TYPE at its previous state.

If the preceding character's JOINING_TYPE is LEFT, DUAL, or
JOIN_CAUSING:
  - In `<syrc>` text, if the current character is "Alaph", tag the
    current character for `med2`, then update the tag for the
    preceding character:
	  - `isol` becomes `init`
	  - `fina` becomes `medi`
	  - `init` remains `init`
	  - `medi` remains `medi`
  - If the current character's JOINING_TYPE is RIGHT, DUAL, or
    JOIN_CAUSING, tag the current character for `fina`, then update
    the tag for the preceding character:
	  - `isol` becomes `init`
	  - `fina` becomes `medi`
	  - `init` remains `init`
	  - `medi` remains `medi`
  - If the current character's JOINING_TYPE is LEFT or NON_JOINING,
    tag the current character for `isol`, then update
    the tag for the preceding character:
	  - `medi` becomes `fina`
	  - `init` becomes `isol`
	  - `fina` remains `fina`
	  - `isol` remains `isol`

If the preceding character's JOINING_TYPE is RIGHT or NON_JOINING:
  - Tag the current character for `isol`, then update the tag for the
    preceding character:
	  - `medi` becomes `fina`
	  - `init` becomes `isol`
	  - `fina` remains `fina`
	  - `isol` remains `isol`
	  
After testing the final character of the word, if the text is in
`<syrc>` and current (final) character is "Alaph", perform an additional test:
  - If the preceding character's JOINING_GROUP is DALATH_RISH,
    tag the current character for `fin3`, then update the tag for the
    preceding character:
	  - `medi` becomes `fina`
	  - `init` becomes `isol`
	  - `fina` remains `fina`
	  - `isol` remains `isol`
  - If the preceding character's JOINING_GROUP is not DALATH_RISH, tag
    the current character for `fin2`, then update the tag for the
    preceding character:
	  - `medi` becomes `fina`
	  - `fin2` becomes `fina`
	  - `fin3` becomes `fina`
	  - `init` becomes `isol`
	  - `fina` remains `fina`
	  - `isol` remains `isol`
	  - `med2` remains `med2`


Once the last character of the word has been processed, proceed to the
next word and repeat the algorithm, starting at the beginning of the
next word.

> Note: Because the processing of the characters in the algorithm
> described above is deterministic, shaping engines may choose to
> implement the joining-state computation as a state machine, in a lookup
> table, or by any other means desirable.

--->

At the end of this process, all letters should be tagged for possible
substitution by one of the `isol`, `init`, `medi`, or `fina` features.

### 3. Applying the `stch` feature ###

The `stch` feature decomposes and stretches special marks that are
meant to extend to the full width of words to which they are
attached. It was defined for use in `<syrc>` text runs for the "Syriac
Abbreviation Mark" (`U+070F`) but it can be used with similar marks in
other scripts.

To apply the `stch` feature, the shaping engine should first decompose the
`U+070F` glyph into components, which results in a beginning point,
midpoint, and endpoint glyphs plus one (or more) extension glyphs: at
least one extension between the beginning and midpoint glyphs and at
least one extension between the midpoint and endpoint glyphs. 

The shaping engine must then calculate the total length of the word to
which the mark applies. That length, minus the advance widths of the
beginning, middle, and endpoint glyphs of the mark, must be divided by
two. 

The result, divided by the advance width of the extension glyph
and rounded up to the next integer, tells the shaping engine how many
copies of the extension glyph must be placed between the midpoint and
each end of the mark.

Following this procedure ensures that the same number of extensions is
used on each side of the mark so that it remains symmetrical.

Finally, the decomposed mark must be reordered as follows: 

  - All of the glyphs in the sequence for the mark, _except_ for
    the final glyph, are repositioned as a group so that they precede
    the word to which the mark is attached.
  - The final glyph in the mark sequence is repositioned to the end of
    the word.
	

### 4. Applying the language-form substitution features from GSUB ###

The language-substitution phase applies mandatory substitution
features using the rules in the font's GSUB table. In preparation for
this stage, glyph sequences should be tagged for possible application 
of GSUB features.

The order in which these substitutions must be performed is fixed for
all scripts implemented in the Arabic shaping model:

	locl
	isol
	fina
	fin2 (only used in Syriac)
	fin3 (only used in Syriac)
	medi
	med2 (only used in Syriac)
	init
	rlig
	rclt
	calt
	

#### 4.1 locl ####

The `locl` feature replaces default glyphs with any language-specific
variants, based on examining the language setting of the text run.

> Note: Strictly speaking, the use of localized-form substitutions is
> not part of the shaping process, but of the localization process,
> and could take place at an earlier point while handling the text
> run. However, shaping engines are expected to complete the
> application of the `locl` feature before applying the subsequent
> GSUB substitutions in the following steps.


#### 4.2 isol ####

The `isol` feature substitutes the default glyph for a codepoint with
the isolated form. It is applied to letters 

> Note: It is common for a font to use the isolated form of a letter
> as the default, in which case the `isol` feature would apply no
> substitutions. However, this is only a convention, and the active
> font may use other forms as the default glyphs for any or all
> codepoints.

#### 4.3 fina ####

The `fina` feature substitutes the default glyph to get final forms

#### 4.4 fin2 ####

`fin2` Syriac special case: replaces word-final Alaph glyph where not
preceded by Dalath, Rish, or dotless Dalath-Rish.

#### 4.5 fin3 ####

`fin3` Syriac special case: replaces word-final Alaph glyph where
preceded by Dalath, Rish, or dotless Dalath-Rish.

#### 4.6 medi ####

`medi` to get medial forms

#### 4.7 med2 ####

`med2` Syriac special case: replaces Alaph glyphs in the middle of
words when the preceding base character cannot be joined to.

#### 4.8 init ####

`init` to get initial forms

#### 4.9 rlig ####

`rlig` substitutes mandatory ligatures

#### 4.10 rclt ####

`rclt` substitutes required connection forms.

#### 4.11 calt ####

`calt` substitutes alternative connection forms


### 5. Applying the typographic-form substitution features from GSUB ###

The typographic-substitution phase applies optional substitution
features using the rules in the font's GSUB table.

The order in which these substitution must be performed is fixed for
all acripts implemented in the Arabic shaping model:

    liga
	dlig

#### 5.1 liga ####

`liga` substitutes optional, on-by-default ligatures.


#### 5.2 dlig ####

`dlig` substitutes optional, off-by-default ligatures.


#### 5.3 cswh ####

`cswh` substitutes contextual swash variants (eg, long-noon when X
        subsequent glyphs do not descend below the baseline)


#### 5.4 mset ####

`mset` performs mark positioning by substitution (`mark` is
preferred!)

### 6. Mark reordering ###

<!--- http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr53/tr53-1.pdf --->

Sequences of adjacent marks may need to be reordered before the
mark-to-base and mark-to-mark positioning features from GPOS can be
correctly applied.

In particular, those marks that have strong affinity to the base
character must be placed closest to the base.

The algorithm for reordering a sequence of marks is:

  - First, move any "Shadda" (combining class `33`) characters to the beginning of the mark
    sequence.
	
  -	Second, move any subsequence of combining-class-`230` characters that begins
       with a `230_MCM` character to the beginning of the sequence,
       before all "Shadda" characters. The subsequence must be moved
       as a group.

  - Finally, move any subsequence of combining-class-`220` characters that begins
       with a `220_MCM` character to the beginning of the sequence,
       before all "Shadda" characters and before all class-`230`
       characters. The subsequence must be moved as a group.

### 7. Applying the positioning features from GPOS ###

`curs` to perform cursive positioning

`kern` to perform kerning

`mark` to position marks to bases

`mkmk` to position marks to marks
